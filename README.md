# GeometricalColonSeg
A pipeline developed for project Xavier for colon segmentation with the goal of improving VR colonography.

## Requirements
To run this program, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `nibabel`
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `cv2`
- `medpy`

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install nibabel numpy scipy opencv-python medpy
```

## How It Works
1. **Input**:
   - The program will prompt you to provide the file path to a `.nii` image.
   
2. **Processing**:
   - Once the file path is provided, the program processes the `.nii` image.

3. **Output**:
   - The processed output is written in the same directory as the `.py` script.
   - The output file will have the same name as the input but will end with `_Seg.nii` instead of `.nii`.

## Pipeline Overview


# Segmentation Process

1. **Air Region Segmentation**:
   - Segments air-filled regions using thresholding.
   - Filters out irrelevant structures (e.g., lungs, patient bed) through heuristics and connected component analysis.

2. **Boundary Detection**:
   - Detects boundaries between air and liquid regions by applying Sobel filters to identify downward-facing flat patches.
   - Expands these patches through region growing based on Sobel filter Y-coordinate similarity, achieving robust boundary layer segmentation.

3. **Liquid Pocket Segmentation**:
   - Enhances contrast in liquid regions using filtering techniques (e.g., histogram equalization).
   - Segments liquid pockets using thresholding or region-growing algorithms.

4. **Integration and Refinement**:
   - Combines air and liquid regions into a single representation.
   - Eliminates liquid pockets and boundary regions that do not intersect.

## Key Features
- Fully automated, requiring no manual interaction.
- Works with a single CT scan to reduce radiation exposure and patient discomfort.
- Accurate segmentation of air and liquid pockets, even in challenging cases with low contrast.
